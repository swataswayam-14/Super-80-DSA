| Type                      | Definition                                                                                                             | Can Access Instance Members of Outer Class?                       | Static? | Typical Use Case                                                                 |

| **Member Inner Class**    | Non-static class defined at the member level inside another class.                                                     | ✅ Yes (requires outer object reference).                          | ❌ No    | When the inner class needs direct access to instance members of the outer class. |
| **Static Nested Class**   | Declared `static` inside another class.                                                                                | ❌ No (only static members of outer class).                        | ✅ Yes   | When grouping classes logically without needing outer instance.                  |
| **Local Inner Class**     | Defined inside a method, constructor, or block.                                                                        | ✅ Yes (if not static) but only effectively final local variables. | ❌ No    | When class is used only within a single method.                                  |
| **Anonymous Inner Class** | Class with no name, defined and instantiated in one statement (often for implementing interfaces or abstract classes). | ✅ Yes (same as local inner class rules).                          | ❌ No    | For quick one-off implementations, e.g., event handling, callbacks.              |
